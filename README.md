Currency Converter Web App

This web app was developed as a calculator for determining the exchange rate 
between USD AND EUR. To use the app, enter a value in the top input field, and
the change the currency type using the selectors. Only the value in the top text field
gets converted and then displayed in the bottom text field.

To get an up-to-date exchange rate, I am using the Exchange rates API (https://exchangeratesapi.io/),
which is free and open to use. Currently, I am only grabbing the exchange rate value of USD converted
from EUR.

The site is being hosted using GitHub Pages:
